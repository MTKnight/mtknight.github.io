                        <p style="text-align: center;">Group work can be pretty hit-or-miss depending on who you get paired with.
                            This can be a bug problem at BYU-Idaho where group work is encouraged and assigned wherever possible.
                            That's a philsophy I can get behind (future project manager here!) and teaching one another is an important
                            facet of the gospel, but when everyone isn't invested the 
                            same way or skill levels vary greatly, it can hurt more than help. Luckyily, that doesn't look like it's 
                            going to be an issue with Team #1! I think we'll be able to live up to our assigned name. Four out of five
                            members immediately got in contact via email and Zoom and we we're able to quickly coordinate not only our 
                            first meeting, but how we'll communicate and share information. Hopefully we'll be able to get our fifth
                            Musketeer onboard soon— things are chaotic at the begining of a new semester, so he probably just needs a 
                            little more time. We'll be here for him when he's ready.</p>

                            <p>For our methodology, we chose Waterfall. Yes, that's not an agile method, but I think it's the 
                                best approach— which is why I suggested it instead of going through different agile methods like 
                                Scrum or Kanban. I'm actually a big fan of agile methods, but they seem overkill for what we really 
                                need for this class' structure. The linear steps of waterfall can be rinsed and repeated for each topic
                                keeping it simple in the best way. I especially like this Escher-esque waterfall to the left as it's a great
                                representation of how we'll flow from one topic on to the next.

                    <p>Collections is such
                        a nice, gentle re-introduction to java. I actually had FUN putting my code together. I did use Collections
                        in CIT 260, but I didn't remember much of it. Luckily, Luis was willing to jumpo right into team teaching 
                        this week with Collections. He did a great job. Between his work and reviewing some of my old work, I remembered
                        a fair bit. I did need to revisit the differences between each example type, but that wasn't too much work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For my collections, I decided to use my kids names and some of their basic information. For my list example this
                        involved generating a list titled "The Godfrey Girls". For my map example, I mapped them to their appropriate ages.
                        With queue, I simply generated a queue of them. My set example ended up looking almost exactly like the list example
                        as my girls are a set, but they were all added to the set "myKids" instead of being listed as individuals on the list
                        "myKids". It's a serious case of semantics, but what else is coding? I'm sure you could guess what I did for my tree
                        example. While functionally, these programs are basic to the point of useless, it really did help me understand the 
                        differences between the different types as the difference was literally the only variation.</p>
