                        <p class="topic">If you've been following along, you know I've been treading water when it comes to stress
                            and anxiety. Naturally, that means it's time for life to pile more on. My daughter had a terrible accident
                            that led to emergency surgery. This would be terrifying for any parent. Now, add that my daughter has—
                            thanks to me no less— a rare genetic condition called 
                            <a href="https://www.aana.com/practice/clinical-practice-resources/malignant-hyperthermia">Malignant Hyperthermia</a>. 
                            Any surgery becomes a serious and dangerous matter. And all of this is happening at a time where being at
                            a hospital may not be the safest environment as the Coronavirus pandemic facing others is arriving here. 
                            These are vexing times, but I know that my stress and worry will not help my family or myself. Prayer, home,
                            love, and being their calm in the storm will.

                        <p class="topic">I've mostly kept a running dialogue via simple little text documents for this journal. 
                            That won't do for the assingment itself, so I turned to the rubric.<br><br>The criteria are: 
                            The Report Exhibits Creativity in its Creation, The Report Explains Direct Evidence of Openness to New Ideas, 
                            The Report Explains Direct Evidence of Self-Reflection/Meta-Cognition, The Student, Through the Report, 
                            Exhibits the Ability to Communicate Well<br><br>Well, I like the sounds of all that, so I decided to 
                            make a website from scratch. This semester I've gone from loathing anything code related (I'm looking at
                            you PL/SQL), to fining joy—and dare I say freedom—in getting imaginative with code.

                        <p class="topic">Websites I designed for my practicum and web-frontend development were necessarily clean 
                            and professional. Their design and functionality had to consider many project shareholders. This website, 
                            though it will be viewed and graded by Brother Tuckett, will be mine. That carte blanche is exciting! 
                            I've picked a theme that speaks to me and my experiences this semester on many levels— hexagonal rainbow. 
                            My favorite color is white. When it comes to color I tend to think less is more— it makes you more appreciative
                            of the color that is present. Plus, what beat a pure, sparkling white? There's a reason temples are white after
                            all. As much as I love white, I'm also a mother to four daughters. Rainbow is EVERYWHERE. It's in this way that 
                            it represents chaos. It's all the colors and my girls have it haphazardly about the place. BUT, white is the
                            condensed into a solid state. Chaos and Organization. Clean and Haphazard. My Semester.<br><br>You're probably
                            wondering how that hexagonal bit came in. While my galleries look amazing, that wasn't the easiest shape to 
                            work with. The same is not said in nature. The glorious, efficient bee uses hexagons to maximize their storage
                            and to ensure stability. I would love to get in on that. Plus— it looks cool.
